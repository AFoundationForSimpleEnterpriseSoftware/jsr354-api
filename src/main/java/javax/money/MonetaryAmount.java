/**
 * Interface defining a monetary amount. The effective internal representation
 * of an amount may vary depending on the implementation used. JSR 354
 * explicitly supports different types of MonetaryAmount to be implemented and
 * used. Reason behind is that the requirements to an implementation heavily
 * vary for different usage scenarios. E.g. product calculations may require
 * high precision and scale, whereas low latency order and trading systems
 * require high calculation performance for algorithmic operations.
 * <p>
 * This JSR additionally recommends to consider the following aspects:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Arithmetic operations should throw an {@link ArithmeticException}, if
 * performing arithmetic operations between amounts exceeds the capabilities of
 * the numeric representation type used. Any implicit truncating, that would
 * lead to complete invalid and useless results, should be avoided. This
 * recommendation does not affect internal rounding, as required by the internal
 * numeric representation of a monetary amount.
 * <li>Monetary amounts should allow numbers as argument for arithmetic
 * operations like division and multiplication additionally to a MonetaryAmount.
 * Adding or subtracting of amounts must only be possible by passing instances
 * of MonetaryAmount.</li>
 * <li>Arguments of type {@link Number} should be avoided, since it does not
 * allow to extract its numeric value in a feasible way.</li>
 * <li>If the numeric representation of a {@code MonetaryAmount} exceeds the
 * numeric capabilities of the concrete type {@code T from(MonetaryAmount)}, an
 * implementation should throw an {@code ArithemticOperationException}.</li>
 * <li>On the other hand, when the numeric value can not be mapped into the
 * numeric exchange format defined by this interface, by default also an
 * {@code ArithmeticException} should be thrown. Never should truncation be
 * performed implicitly.</li>
 * <li>Nevertheless truncation may be supported by passing additional parameters
 * or defining <i>exact</i> methods, similar to
 * {@link BigDecimal#longValueExact()}.
 * <li>Rounding should never be done automatically, exception internal rounding
 * implied by the numeric implementation type.</li>
 * <li>Since implementations are recommended to be immutable, an operation
 * should never change any internal state of an instance. Given an instance, all
 * operations are required to be fully reproducible.</li>
 * <li>Finally the result of calling {@link #with(MonetaryOperator)} should be
 * of the same type as type on which {@code with} was called. The {@code with}
 * method also defines additional interoperability requirements.</li>
 * <li>To enable further interoperability a static method
 * {@code from(MonetaryAmount)} is recommended to be implemented, that allows
 * conversion of a {@code MonetaryAmount} to a concrete type {@code M}:<br/>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public static M from(MonetaryAmount amount);}
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </li>
 * <li>Finally implementations should not implement a method {@code getAmount()}
 * . This method is reserved for future integration into the JDK.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h4>Implementation specification</h4>
 * Implementations of this interface should be
 * <ul>
 * <li>immutable</li>
 * <li>thread-safe</li>
 * <li>final</li>
 * <li>serializable, hereby writing the numeric value, the
 * {@link MonetaryContext} and a serialized {@link CurrencyUnit}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Implementations of this interface must be
 * <ul>
 * <li>comparable</li>
 * <li>must implement {@code equals/hashCode}, hereby considering
 * <ul>
 * <li>Implementation type
 * <li>CurrencyUnit
 * <li>Numeric value.
 * </ul>
 * This also means that two different implementations types with the same
 * currency and numeric value are NOT equal.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Since {@link Number} is not an interface, this type is not extending
 * {@link Number}.
